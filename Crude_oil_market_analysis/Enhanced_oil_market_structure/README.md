### ML forecasting with synthetic data: An application to Urals loading 

High ﬁdelity synthetic commodity data that preserves critical market characteristics and offers an alternative solution for data generation without breaching proprietary strategies. Case study using multivariate distribution (based on mean features and covariance to derive the synthetic dataset → projection for usage with copula modeling )

**Insights**:
- 96% statistical similarity between original and synthetic data → crisis simulation, ML model
development, and Basel III compliance without exposing proprietary strategies.
- Multiple layer of statistical testing confirm a good fit of the generated data to the original dataset


**Technologies**: Jupyter Notebook (Python script) 
**Methods**: Multivariate distribution, Data generation
**Data**: Urals loading, Brent futures (LCOc1), MOEX index (Russian equity index), Brent crack spread (2017-2021, Refinitiv Eikon)
