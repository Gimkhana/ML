### Applied Machine Learning (ML) in Financial Markets

**Comparing model performance across equities, rates, FX, and commodities. When do neural networks work? When do simple models outperform?**

---

### Overview

This repository contains two machine learning projects examining price forecasting across different asset classes. Each project isolates a specific question: Which models work best under different market regimes?

**Central finding:** Model choice depends entirely on data characteristics. Neural networks excel at smooth trends; tree-based methods survive regime shifts.
